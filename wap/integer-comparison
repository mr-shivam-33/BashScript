# Integer comparision
-eq - is equal to - if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]    #compare if two numbers are equal
-ne - is not equal to -  if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]    #compare if two numbers are not equal
-gt - is greater than - if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]    #compare if one number is greater than another number
-ge - is greater than or equal to - if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]    #compare if one number is greater than or equal to a number
-lt - is less than - if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]     #compare if one number is less than another number 
-le - is less than or equal to - if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]    #compare if one number is less than or equal to a number

< - is less than - if (( "$a" < "$b" ))
<= - is less than or equal to - if (( "$a" <= "$b" ))
> - is greater than - if (( "$a" > "$b" ))
>= - is greater than or equal to - if (( "$a" >= "$b" ))

#String comparision
= - is equal to - if [ "$a" == "$b" ]   #compare if two strings are equal 
== - is equal to - if [ "$a" == "$b" ]
!= - is not equal to - if [ "$a" != "$b" ]  #compare if two strings are not equal
< - is less than, in ASCII alphabetical order - if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]
> - is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order - if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]
-n  evaluate if string length is greater than zero
-z  evaluate if string length is equal to zero
